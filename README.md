# World Gallery

This app is designed to help aspiring artists to make a name for themselves
and bypass traditional barriers to recognition, including museums or art galleries.

It includes a discovery map which allows users to discover new artists 
from traditionally underrepresented areas in the world of art. This feature 
also allows them to support local artists, if they so please.
